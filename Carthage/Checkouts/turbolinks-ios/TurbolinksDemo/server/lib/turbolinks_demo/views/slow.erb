<h1>Slow-loading Page</h1>
<p>This page is rendered with a delay on the server so you can see the loading indicator and test Turbolinksâ€™ preview cache.</p>
<p>To see the preview cache in action, tap the Back arrow and return to this page. It will load instantly while the slow network request completes in the background.<p>
<p>Pay attention to the global network activity indicator when you return. Notice that it continues animating while the preview is visible. When it stops, the network request has completed and the preview has been replaced with a fresh copy from the server.</p>
<p>Tap the Back arrow and use pull-to-refresh before returning to see the slow, uncached version again.</p>
